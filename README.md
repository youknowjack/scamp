Scamp is a command-line Python script that uses Selenium with a headless
Chrome browser to search for campsite availability on a reservation 
system used by some US state park systems. It can be configured in a variety
of ways and can be integrated with a gmail account to send an email
summary of upcoming availability.

NOTE: Scamp is provided as a reference implementation and learning tool.
It should always be used in accordance with applicable terms of service.

The `setup.sh` demonstrates how to set up to run Scamp with Python 3.7.
This script has been successfully tested on a Mac with HomeBrew and pyenv 2.3.0.
